Degreens Ubuntu Mate's defaults to use a nicer Ubuntu orange theme or allows for a custom color, e.g. blue, red, yellow, purple, etc.

Will also help setup proper HiDPI support and may make other basic/minor UI tweaks.

Note: In the Ubuntu Mate 20.04 release, and even backported to 18.04, there is a very useful Welcome screen that will help you set up a nice theme using the same themes this script also pulls and it let's you set your preferred desktop layout. I began creating this before noticing the Welcome app, however I find this script still useful because it helps guide the initial setup to include HiDPI support. It can also install all colored themes faster (Customize) than the Welcome app.

Degreener will not automate anything beyond setting good defaults for Ubuntu Mate, while not veering too far off from the existing Ubuntu defaults.
